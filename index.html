          <p>"I'm not a woman of many words, but what I can say about Erin; She was on it! This was the second time I got to work with her. She gets the job done. First house she showed me this year was the one I bought."</p>

        <div class="feat-testimonial-2">
          <p>"As first-time home buyers, we knew little about the process. Erin was very responsive, patient, and helped us ease into the Portland market. Throughout both the offer and closing process she kept us informed and did a phenomenal job of taking the worry out of inspection, negotiation, and closing itself. We definitely recommend putting your trust in Erin to help find and secure your next home."</p>

          <p>"From the time we met Erin we could tell she was energetic, professional and enthusiastic about real estate. She sold our house in twenty days, pretty impressive. She helped us through the sale of our house and the purchase of another in a very timely fashion. She took care of everything and it could not have been a better experience. We will use her in any future real estate transactions and would highly recommend her to anyone.</p>
          <p>THANKS ERIN, WE LOVE OUR NEW HOME. "</p>

She addressed each challenge we faced in meeting a very aggressive timeline offering advice on overcoming each roadblock we encountered.<br>She has represented our interests very well while always showing the appropriate respect and empathy for the seller of our new home too. This was very important as we found last minute repairs addressed as each party felt the other would respond in a fair, reasonable way. I highly recommend Erin and will always call her for any future needs in the greater Portland area! Thank you Erin!”</p>
